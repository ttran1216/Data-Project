# Theft and Loss of Controlled Substances: Malloy Data Analysis

## Background
This project analyzes a dataset related to the **theft and loss of controlled substances** (chemicals lost) within various business activities. The data captures detailed information on incidents of theft, including the quantity of chemicals lost, business activity types, and geographical information (such as state-level data). Understanding the patterns and key factors contributing to theft can help organizations better manage their inventory and implement more effective loss-prevention strategies.

The dataset includes:
- **State**: The state where the loss occurred.
- **Business Activity**: The type of business involved (e.g., pharmacy, distributor, manufacturer).
- **Quantity Lost**: The amount of chemicals lost, measured in milliliters, unit, milligram,...
- **Theft Count**: The number of theft incidents recorded.

## Motivation
The motivation for this analysis is to uncover trends and insights into the theft of controlled substances, a critical issue for businesses in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. By understanding which states and business activities are more prone to theft and loss, businesses can implement targeted security measures, optimize inventory management, and reduce financial losses. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights to guide policy and decision-making processes within the industry.

## Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following key findings were observed:
- **States with the highest chemical loss**: States like **Texas** and **Illinois** showed the highest total quantity of chemicals lost. These states may face regional challenges that should be addressed with improved loss prevention measures.
- **Business activities with the highest theft counts**: The **pharmacy** sector had the highest frequency of theft incidents, followed by **distributors** and **chemical manufacturers**.
- **Business activities with the highest chemical loss**: **Distributors** experienced the most significant quantity of chemicals lost, followed by **pharmacies** and **chemical exporters**.

These insights suggest the need for targeted interventions in high-risk regions and business activities.# Data-Project
